# SVM and Fourier Kernel Approximation Implementation in Python

The implementation of SVM and Fourier kernel approximation is in the file [SVM.py](svm.py).

For more detail of the SMO algorithm, please read [this article](https://frankccccc.github.io/blog/posts/smo/) in my blog.

I also evaluate my SVM on the "Womenâ€™s Clothing E-Commerce Review Dataset" and the code is in the file [data_analyze.py](data_analyze.py).

In the mean time, the [report](report.pdf) also contains the EDA of the dataset and the code is in [data_analyze.py](data_analyze.py).
